I want you to build an app for iit palakkad students. 
Take this app built for vit ap as an inspiration for building my app : https://github.com/VITAP-Student-Project/vitap_student_app/tree/main.
In place of vtop use this records portal for login: https://records.iitpkd.ac.in/ 
After login go to here: https://records.iitpkd.ac.in/course_registration_reports/student_courses to fetch semester list and select semester selection option. 
You will get courses list like this: <<img width="1318" height="544" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 183410" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d8e8be7-5db3-4506-a2a2-2a186bfba0c9" />
from that you need to think and create time table using this slot system  <img width="1195" height="796" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 183744" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f5612b0-59fa-4fd2-9d5a-07bbd6588edc" />
. slot system also present as pdf in this repo.
remember slot system is same for all semesters and all students. And courses and timetable changes based on student and semester. And also remember semester name suggests year, starting and ending months of a semester.Remember this also while creating time table.
In choice paralysis of app give five options in my app instead of four like in vit ap app. options are Home, Timetable , Bus Schedule, Mess Menu and account. 
create a home page like in that vitap student app repo. Instead of showing amaravti weather in home section, show iit palakkad weather there.
In quick access section of home page Only give four options Results, Exams, Faculty and Wifi. Results will be fetched from https://records.iitpkd.ac.in/grades/view_results after login. Exams section leave empty for now.For faculty page facultires details need to fetched from https://iitpkd.ac.in/faculty-list . For wifi section create a automatic wifi login like in vitap app here also using https://netaccess.iitpkd.ac.in:1442/ .create For You section here also.
In Timetable choice paralysis section show timetable.
In bus schedule choice paralysis section show bus schedules of that day from bus schdule.pdf that I provided in this repo in user friendly way.
In Mess menu choice paralysis section show mess menu of that day from MESS_MENU.pdf that I provided in this repo in user friendly way.
In Account section create everything like in vit ap student app.
